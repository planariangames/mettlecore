## Armor

The covers of pulp adventure books and games are adorned with lurid images of sweaty men and women of action. Shirts ripped, bodices straining, nary a flak jacket in sight. Don’t let that fool you though, these stories are also rife with chain undershirts and iron plates secretly saving these glistening oafs from doom.

So, if you expect trouble, and you really should, it is no shame to wear some sort of armor. Worn armor adds to FRAME Soak. The tradeoff is the more protection a set of Armor gives, the more it weighs (kgs.), potentially encumbering the character. Encumbrance penalizes POISE-related actions such as swimming, climbing, and sneaking.

The table below gives examples of armor common to a modern setting, as well as archaic armor types for comparison.

| **Armor**             | **Soak** | **Special** | **kg** | **Cost** |
| --------------------- | :------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: |
| Archaic:              |          |             |        |          |
|      Light (Leather)  | +1       |             | 7      | 2        |
|      Medium (Chain)   | +2       |             | 15     | 3        |
|      Heavy (Plate)    | +3       |             | 25     | 4        |
| Modern:               |          |             |        |          |
|      Kevlar vest (BP) | +1(+3)   | BP          | 3      | 3        |
|      Flak Jacket      | +2(+4)   | BP          | 8      | 3        |
|      Riot gear        | +3(+5)   | BP          | 15     | 4        |


***BP*** armor is “bulletproof,” meaning it works better against bullets, unless they are armor piercing (AP) type. The BP Soak is in parentheses. This is also how armors that grant special protections against things like fire or electricity would work.

## Weapons

The following weapons chart gives examples of the more popular weapons. Each has a Name, Hit, DAM, special features, and weight. **Hit** is the Attack bonus of the weapon. **Damage (DM)** is the base damage amount before Edge and Soak. Special features a weapon may possess are described briefly below

### Specials

-   **2H** takes two hands to wield, so no shield or sidearm.
-   **Ammo** is the max number of shots before reloading with a *Use* Action. It may have to be reloaded earlier as a Twist.
-   **Blast** means after they damage the target, they also inflict 1d6 + DM as Area Attack to others in the target Zone. Blasts hit everything not behind Total Cover, ally or enemy.
-   **Block** adds to POISE defense vs. all Attacks.
-   **Burn** inflicts Burning status, roll damage each round until extinguished or Scene ends.
-   **Burst** grants an extra hit for every 5 ammo and 1 Edge spent. Damage is the same for each hit, minus the Edge spent. For example, adding 2 hits would cost 2 Edge and 10 ammo. If used on different targets, the original Score must be high enough to hit each.
-   **Entangle** damage raises the Difficulty on all Checks instead of doing damage to Mettle. This lasts until someone removes the weapon or the target succeeds on a Move Check.
-   **Grapple** use the weapon's Hit and DM on Grapple Attacks.
-   **Parry** adds to POISE defense vs. melee Attacks.
-   **Range** is how many Zones one can shoot or throw the weapon. Beyond this one must Aim, halving their POISE defense but doubling Range. A melee weapon with no Range may be thrown 1 Zone by Aiming.
-   **Reach** weapons make pre-emptive strikes, stealing initiative from attackers who try to hit them with non-reach melee weapons.
-   **Scoped** weapons add that many Zones to Range at the cost of an Action.
-   **Stun** weapons inflict Strain instead of damage, ending in Incapacitation.
-   **Wrap** weapons are flexible and ignore Parry or Block bonuses.

{: .note }
Listings above are for a “typical” weapon of its kind. To model a specific weapon, compare it to the closest one listed and adjust.
In general, heavier calibers of a firearm lose 1D of their Hit bonus but gain 1 DM. Smaller calibers (as above) do the reverse, gaining 1D to hit but losing 1 DM.

## Equipment

Part of the joy of making a setting is thinking about what tools are available to help those within it achieve their goals. Different items are available depending on the time period portrayed.

### Miscellaneous Items

Aside from being vital flavor text, items can enable or enhance actions. Only jury-rigged equipment does not provide a bonus. For example, a set of proper lockpicks grants a +1 bonus to pick locks. Making do with a hairpin grants no bonus, and a fancy set could grant +2 or more. Very poor gear might inflict a penalty, but this should be rare.

### Medicine

These keep an adventurer up and running, and need to be listed as they have specific effects within the system. Cost is for a day's dose, and high doses do not stack effectively -- the benefits and drawbacks cancel out.

-   **Activated charcoal:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from most ingested poisons. Resources 1.
-   **Antibiotics:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from bacterial diseases. Resources 2.
-   **Painkillers, over the counter:** ignore one die of penalty from negative Mettle. Resources 1.
-   **Painkillers, prescription:** ignore two dice of penalty from negative Mettle. Resources 2.
-   **Stimulant, over the counter:** ignore a die of Fatigue drain from Concept. Includes coffee. Resources 1.
-   **Stimulant, prescription:** ignore two dice of Fatigue drain from Concept, and one die of penalty from negative Mettle. Resources 2.

### Standard Kits

These are standard personal possessions characters in certain settings may start with. These are painless ways to make sure a character does not start out missing obvious things.

-   **Explorer's pack:** basic things an adventurer may need. Includes a *Small backpack*, *Snacks (1 day of rations), Canteen (\<1 L), Flashlight, Sack, paracord (\~10 m), knife, lighter, first aid kit, light blanket, notebook, pen, and pencil.* 4 kg, Resources 2.
-   **Pockets/Purse:** the contents of a modern person's pockets. Includes *Keys, Wallet, Cash, Credit cards, and ID.* Likely to also include a *cell phone* in more recent modern games. 0 kg, Resources 1.

## Hirelings

No man is an island, and even a well-rounded party can find they lack the ability or patience for certain tasks. In general, you get what you pay for. A Hireling’s CONCEPT is usually from 5-7D, depending on how good at their jobs they are and how well the party pays them. Otherwise, they can use an average NPC Extra pool of 3D+3 or so. Favorite hirelings often get regular stats, and are prime candidates to step in as replacement characters in the actual party.

-   **Lawyer:** adventurers get into all sorts of shenanigans, lawbreaking, and general stupidity. Fair or foul, a lawyer can get them out of it. Keeping one on retainer can make escaping the consequences of your actions faster and easier.
-   **Local Guide:** hiring a local or street urchin to show you around a new place is a great way to avoid trouble, but they can also expose you to scams. Most want repeat business however and try to take advantage of your naivety in ways you don't notice.
-   **Official:** having a politician, policeman, or well-placed bureaucrat in your pocket is *de rigueur* at higher Resource levels. Your backer may have a few they can share but remember -- so may your foes. Maybe even the same ones!
-   **Servant:** somehow, party members are notoriously unreliable for basic tasks. This can be a driver, butler, porter, or other such useful person.

While not technically hirelings, the party may also bribe passersby or layabouts. These watch a vehicle, reveal info, carry messages, etc. This is also a great way for the Guide to pass on much-needed clues from a source the party has no reason to mistrust.

---

## Mounts

Riding atop a mount is a great advantage. In combat, the mount and rider count as a single unit. A mounted rider may use the mount's Speed instead of their own and enjoys Partial Cover. The two must share the same Action but may Split Actions between them. Otherwise, treat them as individuals. Most mounts double their Load Step for encumbrance.

The mount uses a simplified NPC Extra Pool, showing their usual Pool + FRAME. The rider may use their riding-related CONCEPT to get the Mount to do something it does not want to, such as leaping over a dangerous obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or staying in a battlefield. Treat this as a Parley Check (rider’s CONCEPT vs. mount’s Pool). A trained mount behaves differently in certain conditions. For example, a war horse does not balk at combat or gunfire.

{: .text-center}
**MOUNTS**

-   **Camel:** *4D+7, Speed 2, Attack (kick 7 DM), Load Step 128kg*. Ships of the desert, hardy and stubborn.
-   **Donkey:** *4D+5, Speed 2, Attack (kick 5 DM), Load Step 68 kg*. Like a small but sturdy horse. Shines on rough terrain as a pack or riding animal.
-   **Elephant:** *4D+12, Speed 1, Attack (stomp 12 DM), Load Step 612kg*. Mighty and steady.
-   **Horse:** *4D+7, Speed 3, Attack (kick 7 DM) Load Step 128kg*. A strong, fast, and awe-inspiring mount for the ages.
-   **Mule**: *4D+8, Speed 2, Attack (kick 8 DM), Load Step 172kg*. A sturdy mount or beast of burden with a lot of attitude.

## Vehicles

Cars, airplanes, tanks, and bulldozers are great fun to destroy. If they don’t finish an adventure as burnt-out wrecks, you may be doing it wrong. Until then, they have ratings for their ease of handling, maximum speed, and FRAME. When necessary, the driver or pilot Checks their POISE vs. their current Speed.

-   **Handling**: how easily it turns compared to others of its class. The modifier adds to Checks to control it. If a penalty drops the current Handling pool to zero, it cannot move.
-   **Speed**: how fast it can go. This affects the Move and Race Actions in slightly different ways. Current Speed acts as a Move in Zones and as a substitute POISE defense versus Attacks
-   **FRAME**: Size and weight, same as for Characters. Encumbrance is a factor for vehicles in the same way as characters, penalizing Handling.

The terrain favored by a vehicle should be obvious from its type. Unsuitable terrain increases Difficulty or is impassible, depending.

### Vehicle Cover

Vehicles with cabins grant Total Cover and can pop out to target others with Partial Cover. Exposed vehicles only grant Partial Cover.

### Vehicle Damage

Vehicles take damage the same way characters do and get a separate Mettle score equal to the max Mettle of their current driver. Being inorganic, they do not take the Staggered or Dead Status; negative Mettle applies as a penalty to handling until repaired. If the penalty is enough to drop the driver’s Check to zero dice, it won’t move for them. For narrative purposes, any soaked damage is cosmetic, with unsoaked damage as bent frame, lost parts, etc.

A driver who can Rally (Mettle 1+) applies the Rally to themselves and the vehicle, so both restore their current Mettle.

- Crashing is when a vehicle loses control and hits an obstacle or rolls over avoiding one. The vehicle takes damage equal to 1d6 + its Speed. Occupants also Roll this damage. If not wearing seatbelts or similar safety devices, count Speed as double for occupants.
- Ramming turns your vehicle into a deadly weapon by sideswiping, t-boning, or rear-ending. Against another vehicle, make an Attack Check of the Vehicle’s Handling versus the target’s current Speed (or POISE if a pedestrian!). Ram damage to the target is the rammer’s FRAME + Speed + Edge. The Ramming vehicle also takes damage, equal to the target’s FRAME + Speed.

In a head-on collision, add the speed of both vehicles together for the damage to both sides.

{: .highlight}
>-	Ram Attack: Handling vs. current Speed (or POISE for pedestrians).
>-	Ram damage to target: rammer’s FRAME + Speed + Edge.
>-	Ram damage to rammer: target’s FRAME + Speed.
>- Crash: Vehicle & Occupants take 1d6 + current Speed damage.

### Tire Popping
Combatants can aim for tires, making the vehicle a real hassle to control. The Difficulty of this Attack is +1 for each tire the vehicle has – the more tires there are, the less taking one out matters! If successful, the target takes half damage after Soak, but the other half of that damage raises the Handling Difficulty until the tires are fixed. For example, a gunshot that targeted a buggy’s tires and did 5 damage after Soak would inflict 3 damage to the vehicle and add 2 to its Handling Difficulty.

### Repairs
Vehicle repairs fall under the Use Action with a Difficulty equal to their listed Speed, making it challenging to maintain high-tech fast machines in the field. Failure means they lose any accumulated edge and must start over. Success means it is unchanged but promising, and every Edge repairs it by clearing a point of damage penalty. A garage kitted out for that type of vehicle grants a bonus.

### Boarding
Other than because it kicks ass, there are at least three situations where one might forcibly board an enemy vehicle. The first is during a Race or Chase, where rowdy passengers can leap onto another team’s vehicle as long as it holds the same Lead (Edge) or lower. The second is a bold pedestrian vaulting into a passing vehicle.  The third relies on a fired grapnel, which enables Boarding even on vehicles with higher Lead.

In each case this uses a Move Action with the Difficulty being the target vehicles current Speed. What they do when they get there is usually an Attack; grapples for gentlemanly races, outright violence if piracy or carjacking is afoot.

### Speed Scaling

Vehicles with high Speeds are faster than their Move in human-scaled Zones would imply. If anyone gets picky about this, attribute it to the difficulty of accelerating within the confines of a small arena. If a vehicular scene breaks out into more spacious areas the Zones also expand to accommodate their full speed.
