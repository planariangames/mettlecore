## Armor

The covers of pulp adventure books and games are adorned with lurid images of sweaty men and women of action. Shirts ripped, bodices straining, nary a flak jacket in sight. Don’t let that fool you though, these stories are also rife with chain undershirts and iron plates secretly saving these glistening oafs from doom.

So, if you expect trouble, and you really should, it is no shame to wear some sort of armor. Worn armor adds a bonus to FRAME for Soaking damage. The tradeoff is the more protection it gives, the more it weighs in kilograms (kgs.), potentially encumbering the character. Encumbrance makes POISE-related actions such as swimming, climbing, and sneaking more difficult. Wearing multiple sets of armor does not stack, only the highest counts.

The table below gives examples of armor common to a modern setting, as well as archaic armor types for comparison.

**ARMOR**

{: .lh-0}

| **Armor**              | **Soak** | **Special** | **kg** | **Cost** |
| ---------------------- | :------: | ----------- | :----: | :------: |
| Archaic:               |          |             |        |          |
|      Light (Leather)   | +1       |             | 7      | 2        |
|      Medium (Chain)    | +2       |             | 15     | 3        |
|      Heavy (Plate)     | +3       |             | 25     | 4        |
| Modern:                |          |             |        |          |
|      Kevlar vest       | +1       | Bulletproof | 3      | 3        |
|      Kevlar Plate vest | +2       | Bulletproof | 8      | 4        |
|      Flak Jacket       | +2       | Blastproof  | 8      | 3        |
|      Riot gear         | +3       | Bulletproof | 15     | 4        |


### Specials
Most armor lends a special bonus to those wearing them. Some grant “proof” for half damage (round up) after Soak against specific damage types such as bullets, blasts, or crashes. For example, someone with a Frame of 3 wearing riot gear would Soak 6 points of damage from firearms and halve whatever gets through.

---

## Weapons

Each weapon in the following table has a Name, Atk, Dam, Special, and weight in kg. **Atk** is the bonus to Attack. **Dam)** is the base damage it inflicts. Special features are described below:

### Specials

-   **2H** takes two hands to wield, so no shield or sidearm.
-   **Ammo** is the max number of shots before reloading with a *Use* Action. It may have to be reloaded earlier as a Twist.
-   **Blast** affects everyone in the target Zone, using the same Score & DM.
-   **Block** adds to passive POISE defense vs. all physical Attacks.
-   **Burn** inflicts Burning status as a Hazard with a Pool equal to original Attack Edge and Bonus equal to DM each round.
-   **Burst** grants an extra hit for every 5 ammo and 1 Edge spent. Damage is the same for each hit, minus the Edge spent. For example, adding 2 hits would cost 2 Edge and 10 ammo. If used on different targets, the original Score must be high enough to hit each.
-   **Entangle** raises the Difficulty on all Checks instead of doing damage to Mettle. This lasts until someone removes the weapon or the target succeeds on a Move Check.
-   **Grapple** use the weapon's Hit and DM on Grapple Attacks.
-   **Parry** adds to passive POISE defense vs. melee Attacks.
-   **Range** is how many Zones they can shoot or throw the weapon before raising Difficulty by one. For example, a Range 2 weapon adds +1 Difficulty on a target 3 Zones away, +2 if 4 Zones away, etc.
-   **Reach** weapons make pre-emptive strikes, stealing initiative from attackers who try to hit them with non-reach melee weapons.
-   **Scoped** weapons triple range when Aiming instead of double.
-   **Stun** Incapacitate a foe if they inflict damage dropping their Mettle to zero or below but do no damage if it does not.
-   **Wrap** weapons are flexible and ignore Parry or Block bonuses.

{: .note }
Listings above are for a “typical” weapon of its kind. To model a specific weapon, compare it to the closest one listed. For example, heavier calibers of a firearm lose 1D of their Atk bonus but gain 1 Dam. Smaller calibers (as above) do the reverse, gaining 1D to Atk but losing 1 Dam.

## Equipment

Part of the joy of making a setting is thinking about what tools are available to help those within it achieve their goals. Different items are available depending on the time period portrayed.

### Miscellaneous Items

Aside from being vital flavor text, items can enable or enhance actions. Only jury-rigged equipment does not provide a bonus. For example, a set of proper lockpicks grants a +1D bonus to pick locks. Making do with a hairpin grants no bonus, and a fancy set could grant +2D or more.

### Medicine

These keep an adventurer up and running, and need to be listed as they have specific effects within the system. Cost is for a day's dose, and high doses do not stack effectively -- the benefits and drawbacks cancel out.

-   **Activated charcoal:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from most ingested poisons. Resources 1.
-   **Antibiotics:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from bacterial diseases. Resources 2.
-   **Painkillers, over the counter:** ignore one die of penalty from negative Mettle. Resources 1.
-   **Painkillers, prescription:** ignore two dice of penalty from negative Mettle. Resources 2.
-   **Stimulant, over the counter:** lower any Fatigue Difficulty plus by one for the day. Includes coffee. Resources 1.
-   **Stimulant, prescription:** lower any Fatigue Difficulty plus by two and ignore one die of penalty from negative Mettle for the day. Resources 2.

### Standard Kits

These are standard personal possessions characters in certain settings may start with. These are painless ways to make sure a character does not start out missing obvious things.

-   **Explorer's pack:** basic things an adventurer may need. Includes a *Small backpack*, *Snacks (1 day of rations), Canteen (\<1 L), Flashlight, Sack, paracord (\~10 m), knife, lighter, first aid kit, light blanket, notebook, pen, and pencil.* 4 kg, Resources 2.
-   **Pockets/Purse:** the contents of a modern person's pockets. Includes *Keys, Wallet, Cash, Credit cards, and ID.* Likely to also include a *cell phone* in more recent modern games. 0 kg, Resources 1.

## Foes

Challenges from its inhabitants show how the game world pushes back against the players. The example foes given below are meant to be adjusted for the setting or adventure.

The Guide does not need to prepare full stats for unnamed creatures or NPCs. A simplified Threat pool will do. Much like a Hazard pool, this is a broad description of their role and challenge, such as “Stunned Bystander 3D+3” or “Hostile Village Elder 4D+2.”

<p style="text-align: center;">[ Check pool ] D + [ FRAME ]</p>

The number with a D is their dice pool for most combat purposes, and when doubled it forms their base Mettle. If they try something related to their title, raise it by two to mimic a CALLING. The number after the + is their FRAME.

- **Caveman:** Threat 4D+4, Mettle 8, Soak 4, Attack with club (5D Hit, 6 DM, Parry +1), Speed 1. Our primitive forebears, hardy and cunning.
- **Cop:** Threat 3D+3, Mettle 6, Soak 3, Attack with club (4D Hit, 5 DM, Parry +1) or pistol (4D Hit, 7 DM, Range 2, Ammo 9), Speed 1. Adventurers often deal with these common agents of the law.
- **Cultist:** Threat 3D+3, Mettle 6, Soak 3, Attack with dagger (4D, 5 DM), Speed 1. Robed devotee of a sinister religion.
- **Goon:** Threat 3D+4, Mettle 6, Soak 4, Attack with Brass knuckles (4D Hit, 5 DM), Speed 1. Henchmen fluent in physical persuasion.
- **Guard dog:** 4D+3, Mettle 8, Soak 3, Attack with bite (5D Hit, 4 DM), Speed 2. A large and vicious dog, stats also useful for wolves.
- **Grizzly Bear:** 4D+6, Mettle 8, Soak 7 (hide and gristle), Attack with bite or claw (5D Hit, 7 DM), Speed 1. A fearsome force of nature.
- **Soldier:** Threat 4D+4, Mettle 8, Soak 4, Attack with Assault Rifle (5D Hit, 8 DM, 2H, Burst, Ammo 30, Range 5), Speed 1. Acts as part of a team, disciplined and deadly.
- **Tyrannosaur:** Threat 4D+12, Mettle 8, Soak 12, Attack with Bite (5D, 14 DM), Speed 2. A hazard of the cretaceous period, but things happen.
- **Zombie:** Threat 2D+5, Mettle 4, Soak 2, Attack with bite (3D+5), Speed 1/2. Special: only Fallen if attacker declares a head shot, otherwise just Staggered. Those damaged by a bite suffer a 5D+5 per hour Affliction, but instead of dying they turn into a Zombie.

## Hirelings

No man is an island, and even a well-rounded party can find they lack the ability or patience for certain tasks. In general, you get what you pay for. A Hireling’s CALLING is usually from 5-7D, depending on how good at their jobs they are and how well the party pays them. Otherwise, they can use an average NPC Extra pool of 3D+3 or so. Favorite hirelings often get regular stats, and are prime candidates to step in as replacement characters in the actual party.

-   **Lawyer:** adventurers get into all sorts of shenanigans, lawbreaking, and general stupidity. Fair or foul, a lawyer can get them out of it. Keeping one on retainer can make escaping the consequences of your actions faster and easier.
-   **Local Guide:** hiring a local or street urchin to show you around a new place is a great way to avoid trouble, but they can also expose you to scams. Most want repeat business however and try to take advantage of your naivety in ways you don't notice.
-   **Official:** having a politician, policeman, or well-placed bureaucrat in your pocket is *de rigueur* at higher Resource levels. Your backer may have a few they can share but remember -- so may your foes. Maybe even the same ones!
-   **Servant:** somehow, party members are notoriously unreliable for basic tasks. This can be a driver, butler, porter, or other such useful person.

While not technically hirelings, the party may also bribe passersby or layabouts. These watch a vehicle, reveal info, carry messages, etc. This is also a great way for the Guide to pass on much-needed clues from a source the party has no reason to mistrust.

---

## Mounts

Riding atop a mount is a great advantage. In combat, the mount and rider count as a single unit. A mounted rider may use the mount's Speed instead of their own and enjoys Partial Cover against melee attacks. Otherwise, treat them as individuals. Most mounts double their Load Step for encumbrance.

The mount uses an NPC Threat pool showing their usual Pool + FRAME. The rider may use a Sway Check (NATURE vs. Mount’s Pool) to get the Mount to do something it does not want to, such as leaping over an obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or staying in a battlefield. A trained mount behaves differently. For example, a war horse does not balk at combat or gunfire.

{: .text-center}
**MOUNTS**

- **Camel:** Threat 3D+7, Mettle 6, Soak 7, Attack with kick (4D Hit, 7 DM), Speed 2, Enc 124/248/372 kg. Ships of the desert, hardy but stubborn.
- **Donkey:** Threat 3D+5, Mettle 6, Soak 5, Attack with kick (4D Hit, 5 DM), Speed 2, Enc 66/132/198 kg. Shines on rough terrain.
- **Elephant:** Threat 3D+12, Mettle 6, Soak 12, Attack with stomp (4D Hit, 12 DM), Speed 1, Enc 612/1224/1836 kg. Mighty and steady.
- **Horse:** Threat 3D+7, Mettle 6, Soak 7, Attack with kick (4D Hit, 7 DM), Speed 3, Enc 124/248/372 kg. Awe-inspiring mount for the ages.
- **Mule:** Threat 3D+8, Mettle 6, Soak 8, Attack with kick (4D Hit, 8 DM), Speed 2, Enc 172/344/516 kg. Sturdy beast of burden.

## Vehicles

Cars, airplanes, tanks, and bulldozers are great fun to destroy. If they don’t finish an adventure as burnt-out wrecks, you may be doing it wrong. Until then, vehicles have ratings for their ease of handling, maximum speed, and FRAME. Related Checks are Use, Move, and Race, with the relevant Attribute being driver POISE and Difficulty being vehicle Speed.

-   **Handling**: how easily it turns compared to others of its class. The modifier adds to the relevant Checks to control it.
-   **Speed**: how fast it can go. This affects the Move and Race Actions in slightly different ways. Current Speed acts as a Move in Zones and as a substitute POISE defense versus Attacks.
-   **FRAME**: Size and weight, same as for Characters. Encumbrance is a factor for vehicles in the same way as character, raising the Difficulty for Handling and decreasing Speed.

The terrain favored by a vehicle should be obvious from its type. Unsuitable terrain increases Difficulty or is impassible, depending.

### Vehicle Cover

Vehicles with roll bars or cabins grant Partial Cover to the driver and passengers. Exposed vehicles like motorcycles only grant Partial Cover against melee attacks.

### Vehicle Damage

Vehicles are harder to break than living things, but less resilient. They have no Mettle score of their own – unsoaked damage becomes a penalty to Handling. If the penalty is enough to drop the driver’s Handling Check to zero dice, the vehicle won’t move for them. Someone with more dice may have better luck.

- **Crashing** is when a vehicle hits an obstacle or rolls over. Vehicle and passengers take damage as a Hazard pool equal to their current Speed, with no Soak! Occupants not wearing seatbelts add a bonus equal to current Speed. For example, a Crash at 3 Speed inflicts 3D damage, or 3D+3 without seatbelts.
- **Ramming** turns a vehicle into a deadly weapon by sideswiping, t-boning, or rear-ending. Against another vehicle, make an Attack Check of the Vehicle’s Handling versus the target’s current Speed (or POISE if a pedestrian!). Ram damage to the target is the rammer’s FRAME + Speed + Edge. The Ramming vehicle also takes damage, equal to the target’s FRAME + Speed. Double effective Speed for both in a head-on collision.

### Repairs
Vehicle repairs fall under the Use Action with a Difficulty equal to their listed Speed, making it challenging to maintain high-tech fast machines in the field. Failure means they lose accumulated edge and must start over. Success means it is unchanged but promising, and every Edge repairs it by clearing a point of damage penalty. A well-kept garage grants a bonus.

### Boarding
Nearby foes may leap onto a vehicle. This is a Move Action with a Difficulty of the target vehicles’ current Speed.

### Speed Scaling

Vehicles with high Speeds are faster than their Move in human-scaled Zones would imply. Attribute this to the difficulty of accelerating within a confined arena. If a vehicular scene breaks out into more spacious areas the Zones also expand to accommodate. The half-mile Stretch used in Mutananny is one such Zone, well suited for the common Speed 4 vehicles found in this environment.
