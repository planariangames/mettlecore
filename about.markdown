***METTLE Core*** is a set of
powerful and adaptable rules to help you
run your own action-adventure themed Role-Playing Game (RPG). This is a
social game where you and a group of friends pretend your way through an
unfolding collaborative story. One person gets to play as the
***Guide***, who runs the game world, dreams up fun scenarios, does the
bulk of narration, settles arguments, and plays Non-Player Characters
(***NPC***s). The rest get to be ***Players***, who explore the setting
as ***Characters*** like actors playing a role. The dice and rules are
there to add risk, settle arguments, and inspire new events.

You can find METTLE Core at [**DriveThruRPG**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/374145/METTLE-Core?affiliate_id=490690) and
[**Itch.io**](https://planarian.itch.io/mettle-core).


This Core game favors street-level tales of courage, mystery, and
intrigue. It is well-suited for detective stories, crime dramas, B-movie
mayhem, daring rescues, tense exploration, gritty post-apocalyptic
survival, wild-west gunfights, Nazi-clobbering, low fantasy, and
grounded science fiction. This focus on so-called “mundane” heroics
caters to an underserved style of play and provides a basis for the
underlying game system. Upcoming games may indulge settings reliant on
magic, superpowers, or miracles of science.

## Features

-   **Adaptable Toolkit:** flexible enough to suit a wide variety of
    genres and power levels.
-   **Easy to Learn and Play:** The basic rules are all you need to
    know. Mastery is a matter of using those basic moves in clever ways.
-   **Engaging Combat:** Move? Attack? Block? Talk trash? Rally back
    into action? Grapple? Protect an ally? Your call!
-   **Freeform Experience:** decide for yourself what your own character
    did to earn their advance in power.
-   **Hybrid Dice Pool:** a novel dice pool system keeps the number of
    dice low, counting to a minimum, allows for direct contests between
    scores, and supports collaborative Twists, Raises, and other fun
    stunts.
-   **Rich Narrative:** players can explicitly alter events using
    Twists. These add dramatic surprises and give players bargaining
    power in the story.
-   **Room to Grow:** the intentional “hackability” of this ruleset
    leaves plenty of space for your own creative additions.
-   **Scalable:** fits all sizes of creatures or vehicles with no tweaks
    or extra rules.
-   **Vivid Characters:** Characters start out with history, goals, and
    personalities of their own. No need to ask, “but what’s my
    motivation” – it’s built right in.
-   **Freeform Initiative:** combatants pass their turns to each other
    or their target, so your chance to shine can come at any time.
